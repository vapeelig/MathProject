// This is a sample TypeScript code to demonstrate how to create a matrix. Note that this code does not include all the necessary aspects of creating and using matrices as part of a math project.
// In a real-world application, you would need to import appropriate libraries such as `math.js` for handling matrices.

import { Matrix } from 'mathjs';

const matrix = new Matrix([
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4]
]);

console.log(matrix);
